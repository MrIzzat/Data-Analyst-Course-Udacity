# Data Analyst Course
 
The  files contained in this repository are all of the files I created while learning data analysis during the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The projects that were created during the course can be found in repositories on my profile.

## The Nanodegree was split into three main courses:

1. [Introduction to Data Analysis with Pandas and numpy](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Introduction%20to%20Data%20Analysis%20with%20Pandas%20and%20NumPy)
2. [Advanced Data Wrangling](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Advanced%20Data%20Wrangling)
3. [Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Matplotlib%20and%20Seaborn)

## Exercises: 
There are also 8 [exercises](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Insession%20exercises) done during the sessions.

## Projects done throughout the course:

1. [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Investigating-the-TMDb-Movie-Dataset)
2. [Real World Data Wrangling](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Real-World-Data-Wrangling-With-Python)
3. [Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis Using Visualizations](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Projects/Project%203)
