# Data Analyst Course
 
The  files contained in this repository are all of the files I created while learning data analysis during the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The projects that were created during the course can be found in repositories on my profile.

## The Nanodegree was split into three main courses:

1. Introduction to Data Analysis with Pandas and numpy
2. Advanced Data Wrangling
3. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Exercises: 
There are also 8 [exercises](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Insession%20exercises) done during the sessions.

## Projects done throughout the course:

1. [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Projects/Project%201)
2. [Real World Data Wrangling](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Projects/Project%202)
3. [Exploratory and Explanatory Data Analysis Using Visualizations](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Projects/Project%203)
