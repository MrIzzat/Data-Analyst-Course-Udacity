# What is a text file?

* Text files are files that contain a specific character set

* Don't have any rules for the structure 

* Have no formatting (like italic and bold)

* Have no media (like images and videos)

* Have lines of text that are sperated in newlines (\n)

* Can bew viewed and editede in simple text editors

A word cloud can be useful for displaying the words that can be found in a text file. A **word cloud** basically displays all words found in a file
in different font sizes depending on their frequency where more frequent words are displayed in a bigger font size.


# Encoding and Character sets


A character set is a collection of characters, symbols or glyphs used in writing and communication. It includes letters, numbers puncation marks and other 
symbols found in different languges and scripts

An encoding is a scheme that maps a unique numeric identifier (or code point) or each character in a character set. Thee code points are then stored in
binary so computers can process and store them properly.

Different encodings can use the same coding set but may assign different unique numeric identifiers to them.

## Popular encoding and character sets:

* American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII): contains 128 characters including letters, digits, puncation and control characters. For example, A has an ASCII Value of 65, while 1 has an ACII value of 49

* Unicode a character encoding standard that aims to represent all writing systems and characaters used world wide. It is used by most modern systems.
Unicode covers letters, digits, symbols, non-latin scripts and more.
    * Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit (UTF-8) is an encoding format used to convert Unicode characters into a unique numeric identifier

The encoding of a pandas data frame can be specified when reading a file by using `encoding='utf8'`

When a string is encoded in python using `encode('encoding')` it converts a string into a byte string, which is a sequence of bytes that are machine readable.
python 3 automatically decodes a byte string to ASCII (but i think utf-8) so it's readable.

A byte string can be converted to a character string using `decode('encoding')`.

Python 3 only has a single string type called `str` that only holds unicode data

Python 3 has two bytes types called `bytes` and `bytearray`. A bytes object is immutable, a bytearray is mutable.
