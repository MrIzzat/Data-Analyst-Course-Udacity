HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language

HTML is a collection of tags. The label inside the "<>" shows the type of the element. The content between the tags is what is seen in the browser.
The ending tag starts with "/" like <title></title>

There are lots of tag types:

* Heading elements <h1> - <h6>
* Paragraph elements <p>
* Image elements <img>
* Span elements <span> Are used to group texts in another group of texts often for styling.
* Head element <head> contains metadata information about the HTML page, like the character encoding or title.
* Body element <body> contains the HTML, where all the tags are used.
* HTML element <html> is just a container for all other elements except for the doctype tag
* Doctype tag <!DOCTYPE html> is used to give information to the browser that the file is an HTML file. HTML files need to start with this tag.
* div elements <div> are used to group chunks (tags) together, like a container.
