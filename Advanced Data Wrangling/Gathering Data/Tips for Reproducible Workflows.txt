# Tips for reproducible workflows

## Folder names should be consistant

A good format for folder names to follow is the the following:


20230315_Microscopy_Image_Data.zip

Where 20230315 follows the ISO date format: yearMonthDay.

Everything afterwards contains a description of the data that it contains.

"-" or "_"  may be better to use instead of spaces when naming folders.


## Subfolders should be named constructively.

For example, sub folders can follow the ISO date format while the main folder just has the year, if the subfolders
rely on the date.


## Creating a clear structure for data files within the .zip folder.
