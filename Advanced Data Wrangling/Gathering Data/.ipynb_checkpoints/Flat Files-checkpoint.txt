Most users encounter flat files through csv or txt files.

**Flat files** are simple files that have a uniform data format. There are many different types like .txt, .csv, .tsv (tab separeted files)

They usually have several things in common:

* Tabular data is in plain text
* Each line is a data record
* Each record has one or more values
* The values (fields) are sperareted by delimiters


The first row may be occupied by a header.


.txt do not necessarily mean they are flat files. Like most readme files.


.xls files are not flat files, as they contain more complex features like having multiple sheets. When opened, they display
binary content only meant for microsoft excel to interpret.
