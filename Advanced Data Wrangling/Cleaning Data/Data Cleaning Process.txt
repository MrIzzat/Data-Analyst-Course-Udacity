Before cleaning a dataset, it's important to keep an unmodified version of it stored.

All the cleaning operations data are usually done a copy.

`df.copy()` can be used in pandas to create a copy of the dataframe.


The next step is to define the data cleaning plan, i.e. how the data should be cleaned. It can serve as documentation so that the work can be re-used.
The actions are then implmented in code.

After cleaning, the dataset is tested visually and programatically to confirm the data is cleaned. Datasets are compared before and after cleaning.


There are two types of cleaning: **Manual cleaning** and **programmatic cleaning**.

Retyping data or copying rows or columns are exmaples of manual cleaning.

Manual cleaning is inefficient and error-prone

Programmatic Data Cleaning utilizes code to clean data. It allows for automocatic cleaning processes and for avoiding human errors. It also allows for Reproducible workflows.


Automatic data cleaning is strongly preffered over manual cleaning, to save time among the previously mentioned reasons.
