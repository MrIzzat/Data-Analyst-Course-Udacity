Analytical data is data that helps perform analysis like: producing visualizations, EDA, statistical analysis and training machine larning models.


Analytical data can be built on top of master data, which is data that is the core data in a company.


For example a product's revenue data can be the master data and the analytical data can be the aggregation and trends of that data over time.

Having tidy data can make data more analytical.

An important factor to take into account is using multiple data sources, which can be merged to have a single dataset. It's important to know which part of the merged dataset should be focused on. Should a merged company dataset focus on the people or the products?

Unity of analysis refers to the primary entity or object being focused on in the analysis. While a unity of observation is the item to be observed.


Enriching data is when the current dataset is merged with additional information. Like when there is a zip code in a a dataset, merging information about the zipcode that can be found online can add information about the average ages in that zip code, population etc with unique keys. 


When designing certain datasets, especially time series datasets, it's important to take into accounte the data granulatrity (Resolution), like knowing how often to take a reading from a thermometer, once a day, once a week, once a month?.

Merged data can be merged based on a level of aggregation. Should population information be aggregated based on states, country or continent?
