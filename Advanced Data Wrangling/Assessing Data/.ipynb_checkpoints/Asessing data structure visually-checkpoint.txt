Common data structure issues are:

* Column headers being values instead of variable names.
* multiple variables being stored in one column.
* Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
* multiple types of observational units being stored in the same table
* A single observation unit in multiple tables.

These can be a basic guide to see if data is messy.
