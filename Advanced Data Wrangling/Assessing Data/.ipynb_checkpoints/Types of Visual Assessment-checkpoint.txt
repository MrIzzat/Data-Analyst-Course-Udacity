There are two ways to assess data, visually and programmatically.


Visual asssessment is just visually looking at the data using pandas or a text editor or in excel.



Programmatic assessment uses code to view certain parts of the data like functions or methods, like .info() .describe. Data can even be plotted.


During assessment, issues are documented (written down) so that during cleaning, there is a easy way to directly review what issues need to be fixed.

There are two types of visual assessments, directed and non-directed.

Directed visual assessment focuses on looking through the dataset through in a jupyter notebook or a spreadsheet reader like excel. It can help detect issues such as missing values, ouliers or inconsistances in the data.
