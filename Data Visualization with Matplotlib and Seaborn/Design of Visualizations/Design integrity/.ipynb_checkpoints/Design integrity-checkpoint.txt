It's possible to lie in a visualization to deceive. 

A common method is distorting the area in charts. An example can be seen an the image (Distortion in area. It's misleading because most users assume that the 
baseline is set to zero, where in the example it was set to 34%, making the 4.6% difference in the bars seem like one bar is three times the size of the other.

A variable "Lie Factor" compares the size of the effect shown in the graphic compared to (over) the size of the effect shown in the data. (See Lie factor formula 
image)

In the second example, the heights of the images are in the correct porportions. Yet the areas are not in the right porportions at all. 

Based on the calculations in of the pixel sizes in the visualizaiton (See "Getting the size of effects for the lie factor" image), it was found that the graph 
size ratio between the smallest and the largest values was around 3.79, yet in the data it was barely 1.2 (see "Getting the lie factor for the second example" 
images).

Dividing the values shows a lie factor of 3. A lie factor being anything over 1 makes the visualization misleading. The larger the lie factor, the more misleading
the visualization is.
