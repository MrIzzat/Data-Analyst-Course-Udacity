Different encodings can be used in addition to color, such as using different point shapes to represent data or different sizes. (See different shapes image)

When using shapes to encode different values, they should be used to encode qualitatively (to encode different categories) instead of quantitatively.

Although shades can be used to represent different values, they're not always great. Using colors is a great alternative.


* Color and Shape are best used to encode categorical variables
* The marker size can be used for adding additional quantitative information

Even though they should be avoided to increase the data to ink variable and make the main information cleared, they can be used to add additional very useful 
information about the visualization. But, if the main message starts to fade because of the additional encodings, the visual should be broken down into multiple 
visuals that each convey it's own direct message.
