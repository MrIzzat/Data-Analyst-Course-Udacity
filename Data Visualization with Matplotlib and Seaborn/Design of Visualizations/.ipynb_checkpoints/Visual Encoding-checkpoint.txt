Visual encoding is a mapping from data to display elements.

Display elements include position (on x or y axis), the size of points or bars, the shape of points, texture, angle, length and more.

The question is how to take the data and best display to audience using these elements.

Two of the best methods for showing quantitative data are the position along the axis and the length.

Humans are also drawn to contrast in color, so color should reserved for drawing an audience to a key finding.
