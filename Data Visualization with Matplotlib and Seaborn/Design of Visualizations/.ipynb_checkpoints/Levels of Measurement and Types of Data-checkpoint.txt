There are four data types:

1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio data


Nominal and Ordinal data are known as **qualitative** (categorical data).

Interval and ratio data are known as **quantitative** (numerical).

Quantitative data include a second kind of classifcaion, discrete and continuous data.



Qualitative data are data that use non-numeric labels on the data.

**Nominal data** is data that does not have any ordered labels. Like movie genres or names of countries.

**Ordinal data** is data that have an order to their labels. Such as letter grades and rankings (1st>2nd...etc.)

Even though sometimes qualitative data is captured numrically, they should not have nay numeric operations performed on them. Like adding the first and second 
place wouldn't add up to the third place and so on.


Quantitative data take data that allow for numeric operations. Such as year or temperature.


**Interval data** refers to data that uses the stable scale within the interval. For example, 5 degress greater 10 celsius can be said to be 15, and 5 degrees less 
is 5 degrees, thus it's an interval data type.

**Ratio data** type is like an interval data but it needs a meaningful zero point where ratio judgments are meaningful. For example, it cannot be said that 10
degrees is two times hotter than 5 degrees(because temperatures don't start at 0), therefore temperature cannot be a ratio type. Length of a document by word 
count and weights can be considered to be ratio types.

Ratio and Interval data can both be further classified into **discrete** and **continuous**.

Discrete data can only take on specific values, like integers. They have a certain limit on their precision.

Continuous data can take on any value, like float. They don't have any limit on their precision and can have many decimal points in their reading.

Year and word count are examples of discrete values.

Weight and temperature are examples of continous values.


Likert data (data that is like a rating system: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) can be considered interval in some cases when the
difference between each point can be represented by a percentage, like 13% negative, 26 percent negative and so on. It'll depend on how data analyst determine 
the scale.
