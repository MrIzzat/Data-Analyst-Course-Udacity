Color can be used to encode an additional variable or split data into groups.

There are some issues that need to be considered.

In the GDP example (See GDP example Image), adding color to the plot provided information about the geographic regions of the data points.

In the bad example (See bad use of colors image), neither the colros nor the legend provided any useful additional information to the graph.


Before adding color to a visualization, it should be determined if color is needed in the first place. If the visualization can be done perfectly in black and 
white (with shades of grey), color shouldn't be added.

If color should be added, using intense color should be avoided unless really needed. Instead, natural colors and pastelles should be used. Grey values can be 
added to bright colors can make them less vibrant. Colors with high grey values have a softer feel and can be focused on for a longer period of time.

Rainbow colors, primary colors and other bright (bold) colors creat noisy visualization that can strain the eye.

Colors chosen should facilitate communication, i.e. what to should be focused on and what shouldn't be. Can be used to highlight key information.
