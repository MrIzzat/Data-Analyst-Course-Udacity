Data ink ratio refers the amount of ink used to describe the data in comparison to (over) the amount of ink used for the rest of the visual.

In general, the higher the data to ink ratio the better. Which means that the more the ink is being used to describe the data the better.
A low data to ink ratio indicates that the visualization has a lot of non-data elements to it, and should be removed.

In the example images, it can be seen that graphs that utlize a background, unneeded axes titles, colors, 3d elements (shadows and gradients) all decrease the data
to ink ratio and should be fixed.

An example of fixing the data-ink ratio in a graph can be seen the "After improvment" image.
