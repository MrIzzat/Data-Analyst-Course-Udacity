A bad data visual is basically a visualization that does not convey the message well. 

A visualization should not mislead, or hide or distact from the message. If it does, it can be considered to be a bad visualization and needs to be changed.

An example of which is making a small difference seem much larger than it is, like when there is only a 4% difference and the graph makes it look like one is twice
as large as the other part (zooming in on the difference).

It's important to keep track of colors. Some colors, like red, indicate that one portion of the graph is more important than another.


Some visuals need to take into account their nature. Such as pie charts not being 3D, as humans have trouble correct understanding 3D pie charts. There is also 
arc lengths in racetrack charts not being the same length even though they are the same percentage, which could be misleading.

Sometimes, like when the chart is small (does not contain too many inputs), a simple statement could be used instead of the visualization.

Adding extra information in the visuals should be avoided. It's best to be simple.

An interesting book called `how to lie with statistics` goes into many more concepts that should be avoided.
