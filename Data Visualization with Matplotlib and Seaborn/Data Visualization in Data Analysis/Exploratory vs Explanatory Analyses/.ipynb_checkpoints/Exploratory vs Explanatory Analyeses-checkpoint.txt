Visualizations can be used for two main purposes: Exploratory analysis and explanatory analysis.


**Exploratory analysis** is done behind the scenes. During this analysis, the goal is to search for relationships in the data, or hidden insights. Once the data 
has been collected, questions can be asked about it. The way that the data is analyzed to answer these questions is called exploratory. Visualizations for 
exploratory purposes do not need to be perfect, the goal is just to look for patterns.


**Explanatory Analysis** is done after finding an insight. Visualization behind this analysis need provide an explanation to the viewer about that insight, they 
need to be able to understand that insight by looking at that visualization. Sometimes, the explanatory visulzation can be found during the exploratory process. 
Instead of sharing all information related to the exploratory process, only the most important information is shared and put into the visualization.


There are 5 steps in the data analysis process:

1. Extracting, the data is gathered from a source.

2. Cleaning, the data cleaned from issues like removing missing, data removing unncessary columns etc.

3. Exploring, the visuals created for cleaning, exploring and analyzing the data are a part of this step. The visuals here don't need to be at their best, they're 
just for the analyst to understand what's happening in the data.

4. Analyzing, after data has been explored, during this step, the perfect analysis to answer a question is chosen i.e. to find the insight to answer a question.

5. Sharing, once the insight has been found, the insight responsible for explaining the insight are part of the explanatory visuals and are created here.
